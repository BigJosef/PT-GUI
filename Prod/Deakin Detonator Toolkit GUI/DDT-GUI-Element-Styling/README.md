# DDT GUI - STYLED ELEMENTS
---
This document is a brief overview on what the purpose of the "*Deakin Detonator Toolkit - Styled Elements*" program is. 

<br>

##  Overview
---
The program was created so any DDT developers can simply copy each stylised element of PySimpleGUI and focus more on program composition as opposed to design.

The program does **NOT** contain *every* element that PySimpleGUI offers, but instead contains elements that will more than likely be used in the development of tool GUIs.
Moreover, each element has additional features/functions that are not covered in this program, as they differ for varying uses. As such, ensure that you are using the PySimpleGUI Call reference on PySimpleGUI's ['*Read the Docs*' page](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
