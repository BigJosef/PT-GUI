## Overview

#### Nmap GUI
``` codinglanguagehere
This module provides a GUI for the LaZagne Password Scanner Tool.

The GUI works by having each menu option for each scan type option within the tool. Once an option is selected from the drop-down menu its corresponding command is appended onto a terminal command which calls the tool.
```

## How To Use

```
Select an option from the drop-down menu and start the scan.
```

## Limitations and Open Issues

#### Limitations
```
The tool was written in Python2 most likely due to the dependencies of some of its libraries.
```

#### Open Issues
```
Currently only the 'All' scan works, there seems to be an issue with the libraries used in the individual scan options.
