# Screenshot Tool Guide

# Screenshot.py

This is a simple tool which can be used to take screenshots of the targets machine at any given time when remotely executed.

This application has some drawbacks due to the nature of the tool, what this means is that the target XP machine must have python installed and you would first need to use some other tool to gain remote access and have remote execution available on their machine.

## How to use

All you need to do is execute screenshot.py and it will take a screenshot of the machine.








# Limitations
Requires numerous steps and dependencies before the tool can be executed correctly.
